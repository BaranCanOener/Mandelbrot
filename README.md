# Mandelbrot
An old personal project from high school: A Delphi-based tool to explore the Mandelbrot fractal.

It is unchanged from the then-compiled version. It was done as an exercise to get used to object oriented programming; UI design; saving/loading data to/from files; simple interpolation techniques; distributed computing; and, of course, to become familiar with the underlying mathematical concepts.

- The software supports a variable color palette to draw points on the complex plane based on their divergence speed.
- An option to record and play zoom rides was implemented.
- The feature to distribute computation using a client/server model was never fully tested, hence it is not included in this upload
